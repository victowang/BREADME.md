# A helper script to build your levain

## Why
I want to make as little starter as I need to make the bread to avoid exess starter and waste.  
This script should avoid using your calculator repeatedly.

## How to use
You can run the code with Python3 with no external dependencies.

The script `starter.py` contains a `test` function that shows how to instanciate, save and load your starter and how to generate a levain building schedule.

You can define your starter with a few lines of code or by writing into a json file

Running `python3 main.py` gives a command line interface to choose an existing starter and generate a schedule 

## Note
Although you could, I don't use my starter exactly when it requires feeding but at a slightly younger stage :  
With my usual 12 hour span betweed feedings, I will mix the starter in the dough about 7 hours after the last feeding. Using a younger starter should impart less sourness to the final bread.  
If you plan to do so, 

## For later
Improve the CLI and allow starter creation from it
