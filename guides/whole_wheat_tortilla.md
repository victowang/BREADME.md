# A mini whole wheat tortilla

# Ingredients
- Whole wheat flour
- Water
- Salt
- Discarded sourdough starter (if using)
- Olive oil (optional)

# Method
- Mix into a stiff ball and let it rest for about 30min
- Roll into a thin sheet on a floured surface and cur into disks (I use a cookie cutter)
- Cook in a pan without oil, flip when you see bubbles forming
- Reroll the reamaining dough as many times as needed

If you are careful, you can roll and cut them while cooking them as yo make them.
