# A mini whole wheat tortilla

# Ingredients
- Whole wheat flour
- Water
- Salt
- Discarded sourdough starter (if using)
- Olive oil (optional)

# Method
Depending of the flour you are using, you want to be around 60% hydration taking into account the flour and water added from the sourdough discard.
- Mix into a stiff ball and let it rest for about 30min
- Roll into a thin sheet on a floured surface and cut into disks (I use a cookie cutter) or divide into small pieced and roll into thin disks
- Cook in a pan without oil, flip when you see bubbles forming
- Reroll the reamaining dough as many times as needed
