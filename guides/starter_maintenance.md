# How to maintain a sourgough starter :

## Basics :
### Feeding ratio :
The feeding ratio, writen __x:y:z__ defines how much you feed you starter :

If you have __x__ grams of mature starter, you will feed it __y*x__ grams of flour and __z*x__ grams of water.
I keep equal amounts of water and fresh flour, so that the starter is at __z/y = 100%__ hydration.  

You could reduce the amount of water if you wish to have a stiff starter, it should slow it's activity and may be good if you live in a place where it is too warm.

### Flour :
All purpose flour or bread flour will add some gluten to your starter, and help it keep air bubbles in it. It is useful for monitoring your starter as you can judge it's activity by it's growth in volume.  

Whole-wheat flour contains more nutrients and minerals, it gives more food to the tiny inhabitants in your starter and it will make it more active than with regular white flour.  

When I started I used a mix of 50% all purpose flour (T55) and 50% whole-wheat flour T150.  
I am currently using a mix of whole rye, all purpose and whole wheat flour as rye is supposed to make the starter more active.

### Water :
Regular tap water contains chlorine, which is good when we want kill micro-organism to keep the water clean, but here we are trying to have happy bubbly micro-organisms.  

You can use bottled water, filter your tap water or just let the water sit uncovered a few hours so that the chlorine can evaporate.  

I haven't had any issues with feeding my starter directly from the tap, it might depend on where you live and how vigorous your starter is.

### Feeding it :
I feed my starter with a ratio of 1:1:1 every 24 to 12 hours (24 hours for maintaining, 12 hours before making bread), which means for 1g of mature starter, I add 1g of flour and 1g of water.

Using a small spatula, a spoon or a chopstick mix starter, water and flour until combined, cover and place your starter covered with in a warm place out of direct su,light (UV light kills micro-organisms).

You could build a stronger starter by slowly reducing the innoculation when feeding (reducing the amount of mature starter compared to the amount of new food) for example with a ratio of 1:3:3 or more. You could probably get a starter that triples in size of more. I don't make enough bread to be able tu sustain such a rythm without having too much excess starter and I am pretty happy with the results I get with my starter def at 1:1:1. 

### Monitoring :
I like to wrap a rubber band around the container of my starter. I set the rubber band at the height of the starter right after feeding it, the rubber band marks how high the starter was initially, then you can see how much is grown compared to the innitial amount. Your starter is good enough to make bread when it can consistently double in size in less than 12 hours. 

If you want to be geeky about it, I have found this repository on github :

### Storing it :
If you don't plan to bake bread in the next few days, you can put your starter in the fridge for up to a week (maybe more).  
Feed it (maybe with a bit less water, as a drier dough is less active) and put it in the fridge.  
A day or two before you want to make bread again, feed it every 12 hours so it builds back some strengh.

If you plan to stop baking for a while, I recomment drying your sourdough starter, to do so spread it in a thin layer over some baking paper, let it dry and store it in an air tight container. To reactivate it, add equal parts powdered dehydrated starter, flour and water, then proceed to feed it as usual every 12 to 24 hours until it is strong again and doubles in size. It can sometimes take more than one week.

As an alternative to drying it, you could probably freeze it, but I have not tried.

### Reducing waste
Try as much as possible to keep the minimal amount of starter as it will grow exponentially if constantly fed at the same ratio without discarding any.

Plan you bakes ahead so that you make just a bit more than the amount of starter that you need for the bread. Do not use all of your starter in your bread, leave some in you container and feed it to maintain it.

## Ideas to use excess starter

#### Share it
Give a bit of your starter to friends and family who are interested in making sourdough bread, it should give them a quickstart. Make the bread baking community grow ;)

#### Dry it 
Dry it as explained before and keep it as a backup in case something goes wrong with your current starter.

#### Add it to bread dough
Add a your excess starter to bread dough (yeasted or not), here are a fex examples :
- [redular bread dough](guides/basic_yeasted_bread.md)
- [naan bread dough](guides/naan_bread.md)
- [focaccia](guides/focaccia.md)
- [tortillas](guides/whole_wheat_tortilla.md)

#### Pancakes ?
You can find many reciped on sourdough pancakes online, I havent tried it yet.

#### Crackers ?
Mix some flour, olive oil, salt and discarded starter + flavourings (dried herbs, lemon zest, seeds...) into a stiff but smooth dough and let it rest, roll it into a thin sheet and cut into whatever shape you like. You can also shape them like small bread sticks / grissini.

#### Compost it
It is fine to compost it, it is better than trowing it away.
