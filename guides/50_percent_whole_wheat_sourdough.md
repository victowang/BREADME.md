# Fifty-fifty sourdough bread

Here we are tuning the process of the [basic sourdough bread](basic_sourdough.md) to make a loaf using 50% whole grains.

We have to increase the hydration as whole-wheat absorbs more water and perform a longer autolyse (resting period to let the flour hydrate) because whole-wheat contains bran which can act like small blades and damage the gluten strands and make the dough weak. Giving the dough more time to hydrate should soften the bran and reduce that issue. We will also have to be more careful while performing stretch & fold and shaping as if tightened too much, the dough is more likely to tear than regular while bread.

## Ingredients
* __250 g__ T55 flour (50%)
* __250 g__ Whole-Wheat flour (50%)
* __400 g__ water (80%)
* __50 g__ starter (10%)
* __5~10 g__ salt (1~2%)

## Schedule
The schedule is similar to the regular sourdough, it just starts a few hours earlier to let the dough fully hydrate.

### d-1 :  
* __5 p.m. :__ Mix flour and water intil combined
* __7 pm :__ Add salt
* __7:30 pm :__ Add starter
* __8 pm :__ Knead until smooth
* __Every 30min / 1h until going to bed :__ With a wet hand, stretch and fold (4 sides)

* __Bulk proof :__ Let it ferment overnight covered

### d-0 : 
* __8 a.m. :__ divide (if making more than one loaf) and preshape
* __8:30 a.m. :__ final shaping
* __12 a.m. :__ bake, if retarting, bake when you are available in the evening (I baked it at 5 p.m.) 

## Result
The resulting bread should have a slightly tighter bot more even crumb, the color a bit darker and the texture should be softer. 
If done again I might reduce the hydration slightly as I found the dough a bit loose when shaping. Propbly something between 75% and 80% hydration.
