# Basic yeasted bread

My go-to bread dough :
It takes very little work and is very versatile : you can make pan loafs, rustic loafs, baguettes, pizzas, focaccias and more.

## Ingredients
* __450 g__ T55 flour (90%)
* __50 g__ Whole-Wheat flour (10%)
* __325~350 g__ water (65~70%)
* __3 g__ dried yeast
* __6~8 g__ salt (<= 2%)

This dough is similar to my [basic sourdough](./guides/basic_dourdough.md) but uses regular baker's yeast. It is faster and less demanding, the process is therefore simplified.  
I often add my discarded starter in this dough, the starter will have little rising effect compared to the regular yeast but it will add some sourness and flavour.

## Process :
Activate the yeast in lukewarm water for a few minutes, then mix all the ingredients in a large bowl just until everything is incorporated. Let it rest 30 min to an hour, then knead it for 2~5 min until smooth.
You can either let it sit 1-3 hours depending on the temperature until it is puffy and doubled in size and then use it as you want.
Or you can let it sit 1 hour then put it in the fridge in the same covered bowl or a large plastic container.This dough can be in the next 2 to three days. Since you can use this dough whenrever you want, it is nice to make a bigger batch (1kg of flour) and have ready to use dough for the next few days.

## Uses :

### Loaf pan :
- Take a 400~500 g piece of dough out of the fridge
- Shape into a rolled log, you don't need to be particularly carefull about keeping the air in, it will rise again
- Put the shaped loaf in a loaf pan
- If you want, you can spray some water on the surface of the dough and sprinkle some toppings on the dough (rolled oats, seeds ...). Alternatively you can roll the dough in yout choosen toppings before placing it in the loaf pan.
- Let is rise a room temperature for 1-2 hours until is looks airy and has grown bigger
- Score and bake in a preheated oven at 220°C for 20 minutes then lower to 200°C for 20 more minutes.

## Baguettes :
- Divide the dough into ~150g pieces of dough
- Preshape into oblong balls
- Let it rest for about 30 min
- Shape into baguettes and place then on a baking sheet
- Let it proof covered for about 1h or until it looks puffy
- Bake in preheated oven at 220°C with added steam (or put a baking sheet / pan with some boiling water in the oven) until it has reached your desired colour (15-25 min)

## Rustic boule :
- Shape like in the [basic sourdough](./guides/basic_dourdough.md)
- Proof in your basket for about 1 hour at room temperature (commercial yeast is much faster than sourdough made with wild yeast)
The result should be lighter than a sourdough load with a more even crumb.

## Thin crust pizza : 
- Take a 100g piece of dough out of the fridge and preshape then into balls
- Let them rest for 30min ~1h
- Liberally flour the dough balls and stretch into round disks while trying to keep the gas bubbles in the edges.
- Put your sauce and toppings on your dough
- Bake on a baking sheet or a preheated pizza stone in a preheated oven at 150°C for 5 to 10 minutes or until it looks delicious.

## Thick crust pizza / focaccia :
- Take a 150-400 piece of dough and place it on a baking sheet coated with olive oil.
- Spread it gently with your fingers into a flatter dough without tearing it, if it does nor want to stretch, wait 15 min and try again.
- Add pizza souce and toppings or focaccia toppings (ex : thin slices of potatoes, cherry tomatoes, pitted olives, rosemary, thyme, flaky salt...). Drizzle some olive oil on top and bake at 200°C for about 20 min until the crust looks golden and crispy.
