# 100% rye sourdough bread

## Ingredients
* 300g whole rye flour (For my first time I used more, like 330 ~ 350g because as I could't handle the stickiness)
* 20g rye sourdough starter (regular starter works as well)
* 260g water
* 5g salt

## Method

### d-1:
* before going to bed : Mix 20g starter, 75g flour and 125g water

### d-0:
* 8 a.m. : Add remaining water, flour and salt, mix with a wooden spoon
* Let it ferment in a warm place for about 4 hours until it puffs a little bit and feels like a foam
* On a floured surface shape it in a ball then place in a floured banneton
* Let it rise for about 2 hours 
* Preheat oven at 220°C
* Flip your bread onto a baking sheet, let it sit a few minutes so that the surface cracks
* Bake for 10 min at 220°C then 20-25 min at 200°C
* Let it cool, it is best to let it sit for a day before cutting into it

# Results ( first time )
The crumb was more dense than I expected, I guess because I reduced the hydration too much or didn't manage the final rise properly.
(Also forgot to put the salt...)
