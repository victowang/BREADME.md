# How to make your own sourdough starter

Making a sourdough starter is simple, it only takes flour, water and time. You want to create a nice environment with plenty of food for good yeast and bacteria. 

The bacteria we are trying to get are a strain of lactobacilius ( like the ones used in yogurt which are harmless ) and wild yeast. The starter will become acidic, which makes it unwelcomng for harmful microbes.

The wild yeast and bacteria are not hard to find, they are everywhere : in flour, in the air and on your hands.

So we want to mix flour and water to give it a wet environment and food. We want it to breathe so that you can attract wild yeast from the air but prevent dust and bugs from going into it, fruit flies may be attracted to it as it smells like a bit vinegary.
We also want it to be in a warm place, preferably between 20°C and 25°C and out of direct sunlight (UV kills micro-organisms).

You can use any flour, but it is preferable to start with organic whole wheat flour as organic flour is more likely to contain living wild yeast and whole wheat has more nutrients and makes the process faster and more likely to succeed.

Tap water contains chlorine, which is good for making water safe to drink, you when we want to raise micro-organisms, it isn't our friend. You can let tap water sit uncovered for a few hours for the chlorine to evaporate or use bottled water.

We will be judging the state of our new starter by smell and by looking at how much it increases in volume between each feed.

### Start :
- Mix 20g flour and 20g water in a jar/bowl, cover it with a cloth attached with a string/rubber band so that it can breathe.   
- Let it sit for 24 hours.

### Every day :
Discard half of you starter and add 10g flour 10g water (2:1:1 ratio).

### Monitoring :
After feeding, it should smell like fresh flour, a bit sweet.

A few days after starting, you should notice that the smell of your starter before feeding change. It will start a bit funky and not particularly pleasant but don't despair, our desired organisms haven't fully colonized the starter yet.

Within 2-3 days, you should see your starter becoming bubbly, it might be tempting to start baking bread with it but it is not ready yet. This peak in activity is due to the presence of yeast. Those organisms will eats the sugars un the flour and release acid (lactic acid and acetic acid) as a byproduct. The environment should become acidic and less welcoming for unwanted bacteria (mould or bad microbes).

After this peak of activity, the microbe population will have changed and will be mostly occupied by a symbiotic (mutually beneficial) colony of bacteria and yeast that thrive in acidic environments.

After a week or so the starter should start smelling like vinegar (from the acids produced by the bacteria) and alcohol (byproduct of yeasts). The one I am currently using started with a strong alcohol smell (like some glues).

Once your starter rises predictably after each feed, you might want to increse the feeding ratio to decrease the acidity :
You can start feeding it 1:1:1 untill your starter can consistently double in volume within 12 hours.
At this point you no longer need to have your starter covered with a cloth to let it breathe, you can use a loosely fitted lid (you din't want to make a small bomb).  
You can use a rubber band around your container of draw a line on it to make a reference.
It is then ready to be used to make delicious bread. [Here](/guides/basic_sourdough.md) is my method for making a rustic sourdough loaf.

The whole process takes time and it can depend on the flour and water you are using as well as being highly dependant on the temperature. It will be much faster if it is nice and warm, but much slower if it is cold (put it next to a heat source).
