# How to make your own sourdough starter

Making a sourdough starter is simple, it only takes flour, water and time. You want to create a nice environment with plenty of food for good yeast and bacteria. 

Do not freak out about this being dangerous for your health, the bacteria we are trying to get are a strain of lactobacilius (like the ones used in yogurt) and the yeast are similar to commercial yeast but are a bit slower. Plus the starter will become acidic, which makes it unwelcomng for bad microbes. Plus your starter should ends up in cooked so nothing to worry about.  

The wild yeast and bacteria are not hard to find, they are everywhere : in flour, in the air and on your hands.

So we want to mix flour and water to give it a wet environment and food. We want it to breathe so that you can attract wild yeast from the air but prevent dust and bugs from going into it, fruit flies may be attracted to it as it smells like a bit vinegary (like decomposing fruits...).
We also want it to be in a warm place, preferably between 20°C and 25°C and out of direct sunlight (UV kills micro-organisms).

You can use any flour, but it is preferable to start with organic whole wheat flour as organic flour is more likely to contain living wild yeast and whole wheat has more nutrients and makes the process faster and more likely to succeed.

To make the starter more welcoming, it is best to use unchlorinated water, so let water sit uncovered for a few hours or use filtered/bottles water.

We will be judging the state of our new starter with our smell and by looking at how much is increases in volume between each feed.

### Start :
- Mix 20g flour and 20g water in a jar/bowl, cover it with a cloth attached with a string/rubber band so that it can breathe.   
- Let it sit for 24 hours.

### Every day :
Discard half of you starter and add 10g flour 10g water (2:1:1 ratio).

### Monitoring :
After feeding, it should smell like fresh flour, a bit sweet.

A few days after starting, you should notice that the smell of your starter before feeding change. It will start a bit funky and not particularly pleasant but don't despair, our desired organisms haven't fully colonized the starter yet.

Within less than a week, you should see your starter becoming bubbly, it might be tempting to start baking bread with it but it is not ready yet. This peak in activity is due to the presence of yeast. Those organisms will eats the sugars un the flour and release acid (lactic acid and acetic acid) as a byproduct. The environment should become acidic and less welcoming for unwanted bacteria (mould or bad microbes).

After this peak of activity, the microbe population will have changed and will be mostly occupied by a symbiotic (mutually beneficial) colony of bacteria and yeast that thrive un acidic environments.

After two weeks the starter should start smelling like vinegar (from the acids produced by the bacteria) and alcohol (byproduct of yeasts). The one I am currently using started with a strong alcohol smell (like some glues).

You can start feeding it 1:1:1 untill your starter can consistently double in volume within 12 hours.
You can use a rubber band around your container of draw a line on it to make a reference.
It is then ready to be used to make delicious bread. [Here](/guides/basic_sourdough.md) is my method for making a rustic sourdough loaf.

The whole process takes time and it can depend on the flour and water you are using as well as being highly dependant on the temperature. It will be much faster if it is nice and warm, but much slower if it is cold (put it next to a heat source).
