# Sourdough loaf with millet porridge

Recipe from Tartine Book N째3
To fit my dough handdling skills I will reduce the hydration from the original recipe ( 65% instead of 75%).

## Ingredients
- 400g Bread flour (T65) (80%)
- 100g Whole wheat flour (20%)
- 75g Millet + extra for coating
- 225g water for the porridge
- 325g water (65% hydration)
- 10g salt

## Method
### Preparing the millet porridge (before making the dough)
- Toast the millet in the oven for 20 min then soak in water 300g of water overnight
- Cook the soaked millet in it's liquid at a simmer for 30-40 min untill all of the liquid is absorbed, remove from the heat and let it rest for 10 minutes. I ended up with 230g of cooked porridge.
- Fluff the cooked millet with a fork and let it cool completely, you can probably store it in the fridge for a few days before using.

### Making the dough
I did the same as described in the basic sourdough method except :
- Mix the porridge in the dough at the second S&F
- After shaping, coat the unfloured dough with raw millet (optionnal)

### Notes
- 30min between preshape and shape (8h30 - 9h00)
- Final proof 2h40 at room temperature (baked at 11h40)
- Forgot to put the dough in the fridge so it was difficult to score
- Preheated at 250째C, 30 min at 225째C, 25 min at 200째C
- With the 65% hydration, the load was difficult to mix mithout tearing, but was easy to shape and turned out good. Slightly increase the hydration next time (70% ?)

## Results
Decent oven spring and an even crumb, a lot a crunchyness from the coated crust, the flavour of millet in the bread is actually quite subtle.
