# Sourdough loaf with millet porridge

Recipe from Tartine Book N째3
To fit my dough handdling skills I reduced the hydration from the original recipe ( which was 75%).

## Ingredients
- 400g Bread flour (T65) (80%)
- 100g Whole wheat flour (20%)
- 75g Millet + extra for coating
- 225g water for the porridge
- 325g water (65% hydration)
- 10g salt

## Method
### Preparing the millet porridge (before making the dough)
- Toast the millet in the oven for 20 min then soak in water 300g of water overnight
- Cook the soaked millet in it's liquid at a simmer for 30-40 min untill all of the liquid is absorbed, remove from the heat and let it rest for 10 minutes. I ended up with 230g of cooked porridge.
- Fluff the cooked millet with a fork and let it cool completely, you can probably store it in the fridge for a few days before using.

### Making the dough
I did the same as described in the basic sourdough method except :
- Mix the porridge in the dough at the second S&F, it will be difficult to mix in but it doesn't have to be even at first as it will even out after a few folds. Stop when all the millet is in the dough and there are no free grains at the bottom of your bowl, then proceed to the usual stretch and folds every 30 min.
- After shaping, coat the unfloured dough with raw millet (optionnal but makes it pretty and adds a lot of crunch)

### Notes

##### First attempt : 65 % hydration  
- The dough was stiff therefore hard to mix without tearing, but the shaping was easy 
- Final proof 2h40 at room temperature (baked at 11h40)
- Forgot to put the dough in the fridge so it was difficult to score
- Baking : oven preheated at 250째C, 30 min at 225째C, 25 min at 200째C
- Once baked it had a nice round shape

##### Second attempt : 70 % hydration  
- The dough was nice when mixing and folding, but was difficult to shape it as the millet grains create many weak points in the gluten structure and it tears easily.
- When transfering for baking, the dough came out of the banneton a bit runny

## Results
Decent oven spring and an even crumb, a lot a crunchyness from the coated crust, the flavour of millet in the bread is actually quite subtle.
I'll go for 65% hydration for future loaves, but it might vary depending on your flour and wholo-wheat ratio as well as how much water in left in your porridge. Might try to reduce the whole-wheat flour to 10% to get a stronger dough.
