My go-to sourdough bread method :
It is made to fit in the everyday schedule of a student/worker.  
The recipe is scaled for a loaf made with 500g of flour.

## Ingredients
* __450g__ T55 flour (90%)
* __50g__ Whole-Wheat flour (10%)
* __350g__ water (70%)
* __50g__ starter (10%)
* __6g__ salt

## Schedule :
### d-2 :  
* __12 p.m. :__ discard exess starter to and leave about 5g, feed 5g flour, 5g water to get about 15g starter 

### d-1 :  
* __12 a.m. :__ feed starter with 20g flour, 20g water. you now have a bit more than 50g of starter 
* __7 p.m. :__ mix all the ingredients until all the flour is hydrated (no kneading)
* __7:30 :__ knead the dough with a scooping motion until smooth and the bowl is mostly clean, cover with lid / towel
* __Every 30 min until going to bed :__ with a wet hand, stretch and fold (4 sides)

* __Bulk proof :__ Let it ferment overnight covered

### d-0 : 
* __8 a.m. :__ preshape
* __8:30 a.m. :__ final shaping
* __12 a.m. :__ if not retarding, bake
