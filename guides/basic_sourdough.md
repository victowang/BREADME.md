My go-to sourdough bread method :
It is made to fit in the everyday schedule of a student/worker.  
The recipe is scaled for a loaf made with 500g of flour.

## Ingredients
* __450 g__ T55 flour (90%)
* __50 g__ Whole-Wheat flour (10%)
* __350 g__ water (70%)
* __50 g__ starter (10%)
* __5~10 g__ salt (1~2%)

#### Notes :
* If you are just starting, reduce the hydration to around 65%, it will make the dough less sticky and easier to handle.   
* Feel free to tune the percentage of Whole-Wheat flour to yout liking, just be aware that Whole-Wheat absorbs more water and makes the dough a bit weaker. I have gone up to 20% Whole-Wheat flour without it affectiing the process.

## Schedule
The making of this loaf is split in two days. Let's say that day **d** is the day you want the bread to be baked. Here is a typycal schedule that I would follow :

### d-2 :  
* __12 p.m. :__ Discard excess starter (A few ideas to reduce waste [here](/guides/starter_maintenance.md)) to and leave about 5g (what is stuck in the container and spatula should be enough), feed 5g flour, 5g water to get about 15g starter 

### d-1 :  
* __12 a.m. :__ Feed starter with 20g flour, 20g water. you now have a bit more than 50g of starter 
* __7 p.m. :__ Your starter should have doubled in size. Mix all the ingredients until all the flour is hydrated
* __7:30 :__ Knead the dough with a scooping motion until smooth and the bowl is mostly clean, cover with lid / towel
* __Every 30min / 1h until going to bed :__ With a wet hand, stretch and fold (4 sides)

* __Bulk proof :__ Let it ferment overnight covered

### d-0 : 
* __8 a.m. :__ divide (if making more than one loaf) and preshape
* __8:30 a.m. :__ final shaping
* __12 a.m. :__ bake, if retarting, bake when you are available in the evening 

#### Notes :
* On __d-1__ the given time __7 p.m.__ is not important , you can start anywhere between 6 p.m and 9 p.m. with similar results. You just need to have enough time to give the dough a few S&F to impart some strenght to the dough.

## Detailed steps :

### Mixing :
Many great bakers have a slightly more complicated process : first mix just the flour and water and let it rest (this resting time is called autolyse) before adding the salt and the starter (salt slows down the enzymatic processes that we want during the autolyse and the living starter doesn't really like being in direct contact with salt).  
In my experiences, I haven't seen significant improvements to the results when adding ingredients in stages, so for the sake of making it easier : just mix all the ingredients in a large bowl until homogeneous and all the flour is hydrated.  
We are not trying to knead the dough yet, the just-mixed dough is weak (tears easily) and sticky. Letting it rest for 30min ~ 1h will hydrate the flour, making it much easier to handle.

### Kneading :
Because we've let the dough rest, it should now be pretty extensible. I like to work the dough with a scooping motion with my hand, I aquired this method from watching this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgz0oAhgwyg&t=331s) from Trevor J. Wilson. Within a minute, the dough should become smooth but still sticky, stop working the dough before it's surface starts to tear. Now let it rest, we will add strengh to the dough with the next steps : Stretch & Fold 

### Stretch & Fold :
If we imagine that the gluten in the dough is like strings, we want to make a strong layered mesh like structure. Folding the dough on itself will add layers of organized gluten strands and make it (expotentially ?) stronger. We only want to do it a few times at once so that we to put too much strain on the dough and tear the gluten strands, so let it rest 30 min to 1h between each set of stretch and folds.  
To do it: 
Slide a wet hand under one side of the dough, pull it up and fold it onto the dough.
Repeat with the three remaining sides.

You can perform fewer Stretch & Fold or skip them if you wish to get make the process simpler. The result might be a little bit less pretty : it may have a smaller oven spring (how much is grows when baking), look less round and have a tighter crumb. I find satisfaction in seeing a beautiful looking loaf coming out of the oven and I am always exited to slice it to see the crumb. It is worth the effort for me but if you are busy (or lazy) feel free to skip this step.

### Overnight fermentation :
Let the dough sit overnight covered so it doesn't dry.
This step will give the dough of time to ferment, the bacteria will make de dough slightly sour and the yeast will eat sugars in the flour to produce precious gas bubble that make our bread airy.   
Making sourdough bread takes time, and making it from start to finish in a day makes it quite complicated to fit in a working day. When I started to make sourdough bread, I had a hard time (and I still do) figuring out when the dough was well fermented. The solution I found was to give it plenty of time by letting ferment overnight. With this process, the dough is always sufficiently fermented and aerated and it just fitted my schedule a lot better.
The next morning, the dough should be about doubled in size, with a few bubbles on the surface of the dough.

This is not the process I read from experienced and perfectionist bakers, my bulk fermentation is probably too long and at the end of the bulk fermentation the dough is too fragile and you will lose some air bubbles when manupulating it. Maybe reducing the innoculation rate (amount of starter in the dough) could make it a bit better but I have not tried yet. I am not trying to make a perfect loaf, just one that is easy to make and can fit in the everyday schedule of a working person. 

### Dividing & Preshaping :
With a wet hand, perform delicate movements like when doing Stretch & Fold to release the dough from the bowl and plop it gently on a lightly floured work surface.  
When making more than one loaf, divide it with a dough scraper or a long knife. I don't bother weighing the divided doughs, more handling means more loss of gas bubbles.

Preshaping is an optional step to give back some strengh to the dough, and it is very welcome since we had such a long bulk fermentation and let the dough relax a bit too much.
To preshape, use your lightly floured scraper to pull the sides of the dough a few times until you have a round ball with a tight surface.
Let the dough rest for about 30 min before we do the final shaping, it should relax and flatten a little bit.

### Shaping :
We are going to do the final shaping of the dough, have your final proofing basket ready (a banneton dusted with flour or a colander with a heavily floured tea towel, I use whole wheat flour or whole rice flour).
- Very lightly sprinkle flour on top of the dough, on the work surface
- Use a floured scraper to flip the dough upside-down
    - To make a round loaf, fold the four sides on the dough and flip over so that it is seam side down
    - To make a oblong loaf, fold two opponites sides and then carefully roll the dough towards you and put it seam side down.
- Use your scraper to tighten the dough
- Sprinkle flour and gently spread it on the surface and sides of the dough to reduce the risks of sticking to the proofing basket.
- Lift the dough using your scraper and gently flip it into the proofing basket (seam side up)
- Sprinkle some more flour of the exposed side of the dough
- To prevent drying, if using a collander and towel, fold the edges of the towel over the dough, is using a banneton put the whole banneton is a large zip-lock bag or cover with a shower cap.


### Final proofing :
If you are at home and have some time around 12 a.m., let the dough proof 2 to 4 hours. The dough should grow a little bigger. I haven't figured the optimal proofing time, but 3,5 hours fitted my schedule (after my morning classes).  
If not available mid-day to bake (most likely for a working schedule), put the dough in the fridge : it will slow down the yeast activity significantly and make your schedule more flexible. You can then bake the loaf (stright from the fridge) when you are available in the evening. This is called **retarding** the dough, the resulting bread should have sourer taste as acid producing bacteria are still active at lower temperatures.

### Baking :
40 min to 1h before baking, preheat your dutch oven in your oven set at 250°C.  
Putting the dough in the fridge for 30 min before baking can help make the dough firmer and therefore easier to manipulate and score.  
- If you use a regular dutch oven (like I do), from the proofing basket, flip the dough in the dutch oven. Be **very carefully**, the sides of the pot are sreaming hot and you do not want to get burned. Use a razor blade attached to a skewer / chopstick to score the bread ( for example a cross on a round boule and a single line across the loaf for an oblong one). Put the lid on and put in the oven.
- If you have a combo cooker (cast iron pan with a large pot as a lid), flip the dough on the preheated pan. This should be much simpler as you do not have to worry about the hot sides of the pot.

- If you do not have such equipement, flip the dough on a preheated pizza stone or a baking sheet, score then put is the oven.

A cool trick to make transfering the dough in the hot dutch oven with less risky is to cut baking paper into a circle with two handles and place it on a flat plate / board. Flip the dough on the cut piece of paper. You can easily score the bread now. Holding the bread using the cut handles, carefully place the dough in the hot dutch oven. You can reuse this piece of paper 2 ~ 3 times before it becomes brittle.

##### Notes on scoring :
Ideally you should score the dough at an angle (45°) to get a beautiful "ear" on the baked loaf.

## Variations

Here are a few ideas to add some flavour and texture to your loaf.

### Fillings :

Add them after kneading the dough and mix until evenly dispersed.
- cranberries and hazelnuts
- pitted black olives and sun dried tomatoes
- mixed seeds (sunflower, pumpkin, sesame, flax, poppy...)

### Toppings : 
Sprinkle them on the shaped dough or roll the dough in them
- rolled oats
- seeds
