# Understanding Baker's percentage

When baking bread, depending on the size and number of loaves you want to make, you may want to scale a recipe up or down. This is why bakers give ingredients with __Baker's percentage__, which are the proportions of ingredients based on the weight of flour.

For the sake of precision and consistency, it is prefered to weigh your ingredients instead of measuring with volumes. The same weigh of flour can have varying volumes depending on the kind of flour, whether it is compacted or not and the humidity level. The coarseness of your salt may also affect the density.

The amount of flour used as reference, so it is always 100%. Here is an example :  
For 1000g of flour (__100%__), 700g of water (__70% hydration__), 100g of starter (__10% innoculation rate__) and 20g of salt (__2%__).  
You can mix different kinds of flour and the total amount of flour would be the 100% :
I usually use 90% all-purpose (T55 in France) / bread flour (T65) and 10% whole wheat flour (T110 or T150)

A few example to understand hydration :
- At around 50% hydration, we would have very dry doughs that can be used to make noodles
- Ranging from 60% to 65% we would have low-hydration bread dough, they are less extensible but less sticky.
- I usually work around 70% hydration, the dough is supple but still strong enough so that I can manupulate it without making a sticky mess.
- Above 80% hydration, I find the dough hard to manipulate, but if done properly may give results with very open crumb. Ciabattas are typically made with high hydration doughs.

So hydration gives a good overall idea of the consistency the dough will have.
That being said, the type of flour will also have an impact on the consistency : whole wheat flour will absorb more water.  
The 70% hydration dough I am used to has 10% to 20% whole wheat.
For a 100% whole wheat bread, I would go closer to 80% hydration.
