## Ingredients
- 400g whole-wheat flour (100%)
- 320g water (80%)
- 60g starter (15%)

## Method
### d-1:
In the evening, mix water salt and flour until the flour is hydrated, cover and set in the fridge to cool it down.

### d-0:
**8:30~9 a.m. :** Add the starter and mix gently in several stages with 5-10 min rest in between to avoid damaging the fragile gluten structure

#### Bulk fermentation:
Warm bulk fermentation 25°-30° C for about 5 hours with coil folds
Perform coil fold every 30 min until 10:30 a.m. then every hour until 13h30 p.m.

#### Shaping :
**13:30 p.m. :** Coil fold then at the last fold lift the dough and place it seam side down on the lightly floured surface, tighten the surcace with a scraper

**13:45 p.m. :** Shape gently : flip on a floured surface, fold three sides without streatching the dough too much then roll, tighten with scraper, transfer to floured banneton.

#### Final proof :
1 hour at room temparature (22°C) 50 min in the fridge (10°C) while preheating
