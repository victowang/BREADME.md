# Chicken shoyu ramen

This chicken ramen is well suited to using a whole chicken with very little waste.
It uses the bones and the wings for the soup, chicken skin for he aroma oil, a bit of chicken thigh for a rolled chicken chashu topping. 

You should be left with the chicken drumsticks and the chicken breasts (maybe one thigh depending on how much chashu you want) that can be use however you want in other recipes or as extra toppings if you want (You can find some recipes of chicken breast chashu on the internet).

All of the components can be made in advance and serving should just be reheating the soup, cooking the noodles and assembling the bowl.

One whole chicken will yield 3~4 servings

## Ingredients
- ~140g fresh noodles / serving
- 1 whole chicken (or a chicken carcass for the soup and a chicken thigh for toppings)
- Some form of onion (regular onion, green onion, leek)
- 1/2 head of garlic
- ginger (I don't because I don't like it but feel free to use it)
- Soy sauce
- Mirin
- Dashi

## Preparation
- Start by breaking down your whole chicken : separate the legs, wings, breasts
- Keep one or two skin ok boneless chicken thighs for chicken chashu topping
- Remove the skin from the breast, keep it and ket aside.

### Chicken stock
- Put your chicken carcass, wings and bones in a put with enough cold water to cover it
- Bring t oa boil
- Remove the scum on the surface
- Once there is no more scum, add about half an onion, half a carrot, half a head of garlic and a few pieces of ginger (optional)
- Simmer for a few hours
- Strain the soup and reserve

You should end up with a simple but very delicious chicken broth. I don't waste the pieces of meat and vegetables in the broth, they may not be very tender or clean to it, but you can pick the meat from the carcass and wings, it is pretty good dipped in some soy sauce.

## Chicken chashu
- Take your deboned skin-on chicken thighs and roll them into a small cylinder, tie them with some butcher's twine
- In a small pot, heat some oil then sear the surface of the rolled chicken
- Add soy sauce, mirin just enough water to cover the chicken
- For some extra flavour you can add some garlic, green part of onion/leek and ginger
- Simmer for about 20 minutes turning the chicken once in a while
- Let it cool and store the chicken in the cooking liquid

## Ajitama
Use one or half an egg per serving
- (optional) With something pointy like a needle, poke a tony hole on the bottom of the wide part of the egg, it should help air escape while cooking making the egg more round, less likely to crack and easier to peel.
- Boil your eggs for 7 min if straight out of the fridge, or 6 and a half minutes if the eggs are a room temperature
- Store the eggs with the chicken chashu in the chashu cooking liquid

### Aroma oil
- In a pan, add chicken skin cut into pieces and some water
- Cook slowly until all of the water is evaporated and the fat is rendered
- Remove the chicken skin pieces
- Add a bit of finely chopped onion, cook for a few minutes then add a bit chopped garlic
- Continue cooking until the onion and garlic is golden
- Strain, keep the oil and the fried onion & garlic for toppings

You don't have to throw the chicken skin, in an oven put chicken skin on a tray, and weigh it down with something heavy and oven proof (like a dutch oven or a heavy dish).
Onci crisp, sprinfle with salt and enjoy a little snack or keep them for toppings.

### Dashi
Make some dashi, you could use kombu, bonito, shiitake if you have access to it. I just used packets od powdered dashi that you infuse in hot water for 3 min.  
If you don't have or don't want to use dashi, just replace with chicken stock.

### Tare
- Mix chashu cooking liquid, soy sauce and dashi, you should get something pretty salty and a little bit sweet.

### Toppings
- One or two pieced of nori
- A few slices of the rolled chicken chashu
- A little bit of the fried onion & garlic
- Some finely sliced spring onion
- Whatever you want

## Assembly

- Add dashi to your chicken stock tasting as you go, until it is to your liking
- You want to have about 300ml of soup and about 30ml od tare per serving (taste and adjust)
- Reheat your soup in a pot
- In a large pot, boil water for the noodles
- Fresh noodles should cook for 1min ~ 1,5 min
