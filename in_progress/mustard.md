# Lactofermented whole grain mustard

Trying to make my own fermented mustard, you can start the fermentation in an acidic environment using an existing living culture such as kombucha, unpasteurized apple cider vinegar or brine from fermented veggies (saurkraut, kimchi, lactofermented pickles...)

## Ingredients
- 45g / 7.5 cl whole mustard seeds (2/3 yellow, 1/3 brown)
- 7.5 cl old kombucha / unpasteurized apple cider vinegar
- 5g Honey
- 2g salt

## Method
- Stir together the ingredients, the liquid level should be above the mustard seeds. 
- Cover loosely or with a piece of cloth and let it ferment for 2 days (or more).
- Mix if you want a creamier result, or keep the seeds whole. I mixed about 3/4 and left 1/4 whole
- Adjust to your taste with vinegar, salt and honey/sugar
- Store in the fridge


### Notes
- Brown mustard seeds are spicier, change the mix to fit your taste  
- My old kombucha is not as sour a vinegar, the result will be different  
- If using brine, reduce the salt  
- Feel free to make your own mix as long as you have some sort of living culture, something acidic, about 2% salt and some sweetener if desired

## Result
Looked great when roughly mixed, cremier when miced longer. It was a bit too spicy for me.
