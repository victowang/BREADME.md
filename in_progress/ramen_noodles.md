# Ramen noodles

I followed the method from Ramen_Lord on reddit

## Ingredients per portion
- 100g bread flour (use 1% wheat gluten if a chewier noole is desired)
- 40g water
- 1g salt
- 2g baked soda

## Notes
Making them by hand without a pasta machine is a lot of work.

I would use less baked soda next time
