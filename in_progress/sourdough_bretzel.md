# Sourdough Bretzel
Recipe from [The Perfect Loaf](https://www.theperfectloaf.com/seriously-soft-sourdough-pretzel/).

I made half of the recipe, changes the levain build to adapt it to my feeding ratio and used baking soda as I didn't have lye, I could have used sodium carbonate (baked baking soda) but I did not have protective gloves. I reduced the salt because I usually find 2% salt to be too much and added a little bit of sugar.

# Ingredients
- 425 g all purpose flour
- 208 ml water
- 5g salt
- 5g sugar
- 30g butter
- 120g mature starter

## Building the levain

## d-1 :
12 a.m. : Mix 13g starter, 13g water 13g water to end up with 40 grams of starter in the evening
12 p.m. : Mix the 40 of starter with 40g water 40g flour to get about 120g starter for the next morning

## Alcaline bath :
Instead of dipping the dough in lye water, I boiled it for 30s in water with baking soda.
- 1L water
- 30g baking soda

## Notes
- I did the bulk proof in a warm oven
- I used all purpose flour, so my flour had less gluten and was less thirsty than what the recipe used, therefore I had a dough that was probably stickier than intended. May reduce the water content or chill the dough before dividing and shaping to make it firmer.
- Going with 10% whole-wheat could decrease the stickiness while adding flavour and nutrition
- Baked 13 min at 225Â°C

## Result :
Very tasty fresh while still warm, crispy on the outside, warm and fluffy on the inside. I ate it with homemade fermented mustard (which was a bit too spicy for me).
