## What is this ?
>A recipe is a set of **instructions** that describes how to prepare or make something, especially a dish of prepared food.  
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recipe)

>In mathematics and computer science, an algorithm (/ˈælɡərɪðəm/) is a finite sequence of well-defined, computer-implementable **instructions**, typically to solve a class of problems or to perform a computation.

A recipe is a lot like an algorithm, so why not write them the way we document code **¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯** ?  
Here, you will find what I have to share about baking bread at home.

## Why I make bread :
I once asked myself : how does bread from supermarkets stay soft for so long ? The answer can easily be found by reading the ingredient list on store-bought bread.  

For most of humanity's history, bread was simple and made with very few ingredients : flour, water, and salt. What about yeast ? Bread was traditionnaly naturally levened using a "sourdough starter" or "levain", which is made by creating a cozy environment for beneficial bacteria and wild yeast to thrive in. The resulting bread has a sour flavour, hence the name "sourdough" and stays fresh a bit longer than bread made using commercial yeast because an acidic environment is less welcoming for mould.

I have always been attracted to ancient crafts and skills, I plan on doing some blacksmithing eventually, but fitting a forge in a small student room isn't a great idea... The best thing I found was to combine my desire to create with my passion for food and bake bread : I still have the feeling of subliming raw materials into something beautiful, but with a smaller oven.  
I am now addicted to it because there is so much to learn : how the ingredients affect the texture and flavour, how to handle the dough, how to manage proper fermentation...  
Bread baking is a truly delicious hobby.

## What I learned from baking bread :

##### Managing time : 
Just like most things in life, making good bread takes time. 
When baking bread, I consider time as an ingredient and I don't start by gathering the material ingredients, but by making a schedule in my head for when to feed the starter, to mix the dough, shape and bake... I feel like baking made me more aware of how much time I have and how to use it well. 

##### Adaptability :
Life is sometimes unpredictable, there is no step by step guide to success, and so is bread. So... I lied when I compared recipes to algorithms, following a bread recipe won't give you the promised result, making bread is all about observing how the dough changes over time and adapting your actions. The journey of understanding how to read your dough and how to perfect your bread a long but very rewarding.

## Helper scripts for bread baking :
I would like to write programs to assist the bread making process (like planning or analyzing previous bakes to gain experience) and make it more accessible.
