# Saurkraut
Saurkraut is the simplest way to get into fermenting vegetables, it uses onli cabbage and salt. It produces a sour and salty cabbage that can last for a very long time.

## Ingredients
- 1 kg white / red cabbage
- 20 g salt

## Method
- Cut your cabbage into very thin pieces
- In a large bowl, add salk and cabbage and massage with your fingers, you want to bruise the cabbage leaves and evenly distribute the salt to that it can draw out water
- Let it rest for a few hours
- In your fermenting container, put the cabbage and its liquid and add a weight on top so that the cabbage stays below the liquid
- I let it ferment for at least 1 month at room temperature, once sour to your liking, store in the fridge (It should last almost forever)

## Notes
You can add carrots or spices for some flavour and colour
