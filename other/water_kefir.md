# Water kefir
Water kefir is a fermented drink made using small grains of bacteria and yeast, you can get them from someone who makes kefir or buy them online.

## Requirements



## Ingredients
- 1L water
- 20g cane sugar (adjust to your liking with future batches +- 10g)
- 20g kefir grains
- 1 dried fig
- 1 slice of lemon

## Method
- Dissolve the sugar in the water in your container
- Add the grains, the dried fig and the slice of lemon
- Let it ferment for 24 hours, the fig should float to the surface
- Put in a bottle, add disired flavourings and ferment at room temperarure for 24 hours
- Store in the fridge and consume within a few days

## Flavourings
You can flavour your drink with herbs and fruits, the sugar from added fruits will give food for the yeast and add carbonation.  

Be aware that pieces of fruit that you put in yout bottles are likely to plump up, so I like to cut them in small pieces or matchsticks, you can also blend them.  

Here are some flavourings that I like :
- Add 1 passion fruit to 1L of kombucha (Half a passion fruit should give enough flavour)
- Add a few pieces of hibiscus and a few raspberries (frozen ones work)
- Add a few pieces of hibiscus and a few strawberries
- Some lemon / orange juice
- Ginger

## Notes
- After each batch, the grains will grow, you can store then in the fridge in sweetened water, share them with your friends :)
- You can find ways to use the grains, like adding them to smoothies for a probiotic boost
