# Kvass

Kvass is a fermented drink that is popular in Eastern Europe, it is made by extracting sugars from rye bread and fermenting it to produce a drink similar to beer. As I choose to innoculate it with sourdough starter, the result should have a low alcohol content and be sour. Using commercial yeast should make an end product closer to beer, with a higher alcohol content and be less sour.

## First attempt :
I only had regular white sourdough bread on hand so this is what I used instead of the traditionnal rye.
My sourdough starter is 30% rye 70% wheat.

### Ingredients :
- 150g stale sourdough bread, 110g after toasting
- 60 g honey
- 1 tsp sourdough starter
- 1L water

Yields about 600g is end product.

### Instructions :

- Cut bread into cubes and toast in oven at 200Â°C untill dry and colored.  
- Add 1L of boiling water to your toasted bread and let sit for 4-24 hours.  
- Strain the liquid, weigh it and add honey and starter to the liquid accordingly (I could only extract 600ml from 1L of input water, so I scaled down the amount of sugar to 36g of honey and about half a teaspoon of sourdough starter).  
- Put in your fermentation container, I use glass preserving jars without the rubber seal, so that the produced gas can escape ( no risk of explosion ) and very little outside air can enter (reduce spoilage risks)
- Let it sir in a warm place out of direct sunlight for about a week (I did 5 days, it should foam on the surface, have very little sweetness left and should be able to smell alcohol)
- Strain again and put in glass bottles (pressure-safe flip top bottles or beer bottles), you can add a few raisins in each bottle : it provides some flavour and extra sugar for the yeast to feed on and produce more carbonation in the final drink.
- Let is sit one day at room temperature so it can produce some CO2 in a closed envitonment this time.
- Store in the fridge (CO2 is more soluble in colder water so you should get a fizzier drink and it the cold slows down the fermentation for storage) and consume within a fewdays, as the drink should become incresingly sour (acid producing bacteria are still active in colder environments).

### Result :
I was too lasy to use a cloth to properly filter the liquid before bottling, so I had a lot of deposit at the bottom of the bottle, don't do that.

The drink was quite fizzy (I spilled some when opening the bottle), when tasting, I felt some saltiness at first and then it felt like a light and sour beer. The sourness increses the next day. If you resude the fermentation time, you could have some sweetness left.

## Second attempt :
This time I wanted to go the traditional route : 100% rye bread and rye sourdough starter, I also doubled the batch

### Ingredients :
- 300g rye sourdough bread, 200g after toasting
- 2L water
- 50g sweetener / Liter of liquid after straining
- 2 tsp sourdough starter

After soaking, it yielded about 1.3L of liquid, so I scaled the amount of sugar to it : 10g on honey + 55g sugar (65g total, following the 50g/L ratio).  
I think you could add the sugar and honey when soaking, but I don't like the idea of wasting sugar and honey in the soaked bread that I don't reuse ( you might be able to add it in bread ).

### Flavourings (Added when soaking the bread) :
- zest from half an orange
- half a teaspoon of whole corriander seeds

### Result
While fermenting, the kvass had a strong rye bread smell that reminded me of candied orange.

The fermentation went much faster this time, after 2,5 days it tasted sour and has no sweetness left, it had a slight alcohol smell (less than the previous batch).
I decided to go ahead and bottle it. 

Maybe because it is warmer ? Because the rye starter is more active than the wheat & rye from the first time ? Because I used rye bread ? Because sugars in cane sugar is faster to metabolize than sugars in honey ? Too many variables to figure out which factors were significant...
I decided to add 1g of sugar per liter of kvass before bottling (similar to what is done with beer brewing to encourage carbonation) 

As it tasted sour enough before bottling, I skipped the day of fermentation at room temperature and put them staight into the fridge

### Notes on straining
I kinda messed up when bottling, I tried to filter with a cloth, but it got clogged pretty fast and I had stirred the kvass to add sugar in it before bottling so all the sediments were mixed in the kvass and I  couldn't filter it out.

My mesh strainer is not fine enough to filter all the small particules in the kvass and when trying to use a clothdidn't work for me.

The best option for get a clearer result would be to not stir the kvass before bottling and carefully pouring it in your bottles withour disturbing the sediment settled at the bottom. Likewise when serving, pour slowly to avoid getting sediments in your glass. if adding sugar when bottling, add it directly in the bottles.

I have read that the deposit at the bottom can be used as a kvass starter instead of sourdough starter, store it in the fridge in sweetened water until needed, you might need to refresh it with sweeteded water once a week like when storing water kefir grains.

# Future notes
- Try flavouring with hops or pine
- Use more sugar and let it ferment longer if a more alcoholic beverage is desired, but the sourness will probably increase as well
