# Kvass

Kvass is a fermented drink that is popular in Eastern Europe, it is made by extracting sugars from rye bread and fermenting it to produce a drink similar to beer. As I choose to innoculate it with sourdough starter, the result should have a low alcohol content and be sour. Using commercial yeast should make an end product closer to beer, with a higher alcohol content and be less sour. 

## First attempt :
I only had regular white sourdough bread on hand so this is what I used instead of the traditionnal rye.
My sourdough starter is 30% rye 70% wheat.

### Ingredients :
- 150g stale sourdough bread, 110g after toasting
- 50 g honey
- 1 tsp sourdough starter
- 1L water

Yields about 600g is end product.

### Instructions :

- Cut bread into cubes and toast in oven at 200Â°C untill dry and colored.  
- Add 1L of boiling water to your toasted bread and let sit for 4-24 hours.  
- Strain the liquid and add honey and starter to the liquid.  
- Put in your fermentation container, I use glass preserving jars without the rubber seal, so that the produced gas can escape ( no risk of explosion ) and very little outside air can enter (reduce spoilage risks)
- Let it sir in a warm place out of direct sunlight for about a week (I did 5 days, it should foam on the surface, have very little sweetness left and should be able to smell alcohol)
- Strain again and put in glass bottles (pressure-safe flip top bottles or beer bottles), you can add a few raisins in each bottle : it provides some flavour and extra sugar for the yeast to feed on and produce more carbonation in the final drink.
- Let is sit one day at room temperature so it can produce some CO2 in a closed envitonment this time.
- Store in the fridge (CO2 is more soluble in colder water so you should get a fizzier drink and it the cold slows down the fermentation for storage) and consume within a fewdays, as the drink should become incresingly sour (acid producing bacteria are still active in colder environments).

### Result :
I was too lasy to use a cloth to properly filter the liquid before bottling, so I had a lot of deposit at the bottom of the bottle, don't do that.

The drink was quite fizzy (I spilled some when opening the bottle), when tasting, I felt some saltiness at first and then it felt like a light and sour beer. The sourness increses the next day. If you resude the fermentation time, you could have some sweetness left.

## Second attempt :
This time I wanted to go the traditional route : 100% rye bread and rye sourdough starter, I also doubled the batch

### Ingredients :
- 300g rye sourdough bread, 200g after toasting
- 100 g honey/sugar (or mix)
- 2 tsp sourdough starter
- 2L water

## Flavourings (Added when soaking the bread) :
- zest from half an orange
- half a teaspoon of whole corriander seeds
