# Kvass

Kvass is a fermented drink that is popular in Eastern Europe, it is made by extracting sugars from rye bread and fermenting it to produce a drink similar to beer. As I choose to innoculate it with sourdough starter, the result should have a low alcohol content and be sour. Using commercial yeast should make an end product closer to beer, with a higher alcohol content and be less sour. 

## First attempt :
I followed instruction from [here](https://www.fermentingforfoodies.com/traditonal-sourdough-kvass/) and scaled it to a 1L batch and tried to convert measurements to grams.  
I only had regular white sourdough bread on hand so this is what I used instead of the traditionnal rye.
My sourdough starter is 30% rye 70% wheat.

### Ingredients :
- 150g stale sourdough bread, 110g after toasting
- 50 g honey
- 1 tsp sourdough starter
- 1L water

### Instructions :

- Cut bread into cubes and toast in oven at 200Â°C untill dry and colored.  
- Add 1L of boiling water to your toasted bread and let sit for 4-24 hours.  
- Strain the liquid and add honey and starter to the liquid.  
- Put in your fermentation container, I use glass preserving jars without the rubber seal, so that the produced gas can escape ( no risk of explosion ) and very little outside air can enter (reduce spoilage risks)
- Let it sir in a warm place out of direct sunlight for about a week (I did 5 days, it should foam on the surface, have very little sweetness left and should be able to smell alcohol)
- Strain again and put in glass bottles, you can add a few raisins in each bottle : it provides some extra sugar for the yeast to feed on and produce more carbonation in the final drink.
- Store in the fridge (CO2 is more soluble in colder water so you should get a fizzier drink and it the cold slows down the fermentation for storage) and consume within a fewdays, as the drink should become incresingly sour (acid producing bacteria are still active in colder environments).
