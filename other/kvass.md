# Kvass

Kvass is a fermented drink that is popular in Eastern Europe, it is made by extracting sugars from rye bread and fermenting it to produce a drink similar to beer. As I choose to innoculate it with sourdough starter, the result should have a low alcohol content and be sour. Using commercial yeast should make an end product closer to beer, with a higher alcohol content and be less sour. 

## First attempt :
I only had regular white sourdough bread on hand so this is what I used instead of the traditionnal rye.
My sourdough starter is 30% rye 70% wheat.

### Ingredients :
- 150g stale sourdough bread, 110g after toasting
- 60 g honey
- 1 tsp sourdough starter
- 1L water

Yields about 600g is end product.

### Instructions :

- Cut bread into cubes and toast in oven at 200Â°C untill dry and colored.  
- Add 1L of boiling water to your toasted bread and let sit for 4-24 hours.  
- Strain the liquid and add honey and starter to the liquid. As the bread soaked up quite a bit of water, I could only extract 600ml from 1L of input water, so I scaled down the amount of sugar to 36g of honey and about half a teaspoon of sourdough starter.  
- Put in your fermentation container, I use glass preserving jars without the rubber seal, so that the produced gas can escape ( no risk of explosion ) and very little outside air can enter (reduce spoilage risks)
- Let it sir in a warm place out of direct sunlight for about a week (I did 5 days, it should foam on the surface, have very little sweetness left and should be able to smell alcohol)
- Strain again and put in glass bottles (pressure-safe flip top bottles or beer bottles), you can add a few raisins in each bottle : it provides some flavour and extra sugar for the yeast to feed on and produce more carbonation in the final drink.
- Let is sit one day at room temperature so it can produce some CO2 in a closed envitonment this time.
- Store in the fridge (CO2 is more soluble in colder water so you should get a fizzier drink and it the cold slows down the fermentation for storage) and consume within a fewdays, as the drink should become incresingly sour (acid producing bacteria are still active in colder environments).

### Result :
I was too lasy to use a cloth to properly filter the liquid before bottling, so I had a lot of deposit at the bottom of the bottle, don't do that.

The drink was quite fizzy (I spilled some when opening the bottle), it tasted slightly salty, sour and like a light beer. The sourness incresed the next day. If you reduce the fermentation time, you could have some sweetness left.

### Notes for next time :
* Try using less salt in the bread if made with the intent of making kvass
* Try using rye bread & starter for a more traditional kvass
* Try using sugar or a combination of sugar and honey
* Try toasting more or less and see how it affects the flafour and colour
* Try leaving the bread to ferment in the liquid until bottling (more flavour?)
* Try adding flavouring elements : lemon zest, hops, pine, berries, raisins...
