# Kimchi
The fermentation process is similar to saurkraut, but it uses chinese cabbage is fermented with Korean red pepper flakes to have a spicy and tangy result. 

## Ingredients
- Chinese/Nappa cabbage
- Salt
- Gochugaru (Korean pepper flakes)
- Garlic
- Ginger ( if you like it, I don't )
- Onion
- Soy sauce
- Miso (optional)
- Spring onions (optional)
- Daikon radish (optional)
- Apple/nashi pear (optional but highly recommended)
- Carrots (optional)

### Notes

Some recipes use fish sauce and fermented shrinp paste, I don't use them.  
Traditionally they also use a paste made from rice flour and water so that the seasoning sticks to the cabbage.
## Method
- Cut the cabbage into small pieces (traditionally it is cut into 2 or 4 large pieces but I want bite size pieces that I don't have to cut each time I want to eat some)

- In a large bowl, massage the salt into the cabbage, then let it sit for a few hours
- Strain the cabbage
- In a blender, blend onions and garlix into a paste, then add soy sauce, gochugaru, and other seasonings, I eyeball it, you should get a salty and spicy paste
- If not using apple/pear, add about a teaspoon of sugar
- Mix all your cabbage + other fruits/vegetables with your seazoning paste
- Pack tightly into your fermentation container
- I let it ferment for at least one week you you can taste as it ferments and store in the fridge when it reached your desired sourness
