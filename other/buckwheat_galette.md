# Fermented buckwheat galette :

Galettes are thin buckwheat crepes usually eater with savoury toppings, it is made simply with buckwheat flour, water salt and sometimes egg (some recipes use whipped egg whites to add air to the batter). I wanted to try to add a twist by fermenting the batter to add depth of flavour and adding the desired airiness through fermentation. It can be a good way to use discarded mature sourdough starter.

## Ingredients
* __500 g__ buckwheat flour (100%)
* __50 g__ sourdough starter (10%)
* __1000 g__ water (200%)
* __15 g__ salt (3%)

Yields about x (to be determined)  medium sized galettes

## Method 
* Mix the flour, starter and two thirds of the water, you shound get a pancake batter consistency
* Let it ferment covered for 24 hours, it should befome foamy.
* Add the salt and remaining starter slowly and judge the consistency, you should get a pretty thin batter
* Let it sit for 1h
* Before cooking, gently stir to make the batter homogenous
* Cook in a crepe pan or large flat pan with a bit of butter, pour about a ladel of batter and tilt the pan to distribute the batter into an even and thin layer
* Flip and cook for about x minutes
* Add desired toppings, for example ham eggs and cheese

## Bonus
You can cut the galettes in small pieces and dry them in the oven to make then into buckwheat crisps
