# Kombucha

Kombucha is a fermented drink made from sweetened tea, I prefer using green tea but you can use any kind of unflavoured tea (black tea, oolong...).

## Requirements
To make kombucha, you need a starter culture often colled a SCOBY (Symbiotic Culture Of Bacteria and Yeast), it looks like a floating disk. Ideally you can get one from someone who has some to share, or you can buy it online or grow it from a store bought bottle on unpasturized kombucha (google it). 

You also need a container to ferment in, for small batched you can use straight sided glass containers, for bigger batches you can use a large glass drink dispenser.

When starting you need to be patient. In the container you want to eventually make you drink in, add the scoby you have with the liquid it came in. Add room temperature sweetened tea (1L water / 20g tea / 70g sugar), you should add about as much sweetened tea as your initial liquid.

Cover the top with some cloth, put it in a warm place out of direct sunlight and forget about it, seriously don't touch it for at least 1 month. A disk will slowly form on the surface, it will be ready to brew when it is at least 0.5cm ~1 cm thick.


## Ingredients
- 1L water
- 20 tea (I use loose leaf green tea)
- 60g cane sugar (adjust to your liking with future batches +- 10g)
- 100 ml starter ( unflavoured kombucha from the previous batch )

## Method
- Bring half of the water to a boil
- Add tea and sugar
- Let it steep for 10-20 min
- Add the remaining room temperature water, the liquid should be slightly warm but not hot, it if is hot, wait for it to cool down (or add a few ice cubes if you don't want to wait)
- In you fermenting container, add the sweetened tea and the starter
- Gently place your scoby on the surface of the water, it might sink but it's fine
- Let it ferment 5~7 days depending on the temperature
- Put in bottles (I use beer / lemonade glass bottles) and add flavourings
- Let it ferment at least 3~7 days at room temperature
- Store in the fridge or in a cool place, as it matures the sourness will increase and there will be no sweetness left

## Flavourings
You can flavour your drink with herbs and fruits, the sugar from added fruits will give food for the yeast and add carbonation.  

Be aware that pieces of fruit that you put in yout bottles are likely to plump up, so I like to cut them in small pieces or matchsticks, you can also blend them.  

Here are some flavourings that I like :
- Add 1 passion fruit to 1L of kombucha (Half a passion fruit should give enough flavour)
- Add a few pieces of hibiscus and a few raspberries (frozen ones work)
- Add a few pieces of hibiscus and a few strawberries
- Add about a teaspoon of peach syrup (wit has few additives as possible) and some fresh mint leaves
- Some lemon / orange juice
- Ginger
